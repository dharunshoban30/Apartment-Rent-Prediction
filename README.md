# Apartment Rent Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict apartment rental prices in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project is `apartment_rent.csv` from Kaggle. The goal is to apply various machine learning techniques to predict rental prices accurately, analyze the results, and provide insights.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Understand the factors influencing apartment rental prices.
- Apply data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to the dataset.
- Implement and compare different machine learning models for rent prediction.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
- Draw insights and make recommendations based on the analysis.

## Contents
This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction**:
    - Overview of the housing market in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor.
    - Importance of predicting rental prices.
    - Introduction to the dataset and data source.

2. **Data Preparation**:
    - Loading and preprocessing the `apartment_rent.csv` dataset.
    - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
    - Visualization and analysis of key features and their relationships with rental prices.

4. **Implementing Machine Learning Models**:
    - Detailed step-by-step implementation of various machine learning models, including:
      - Linear Regression
      - Decision Trees
      - Random Forest
      - Gradient Boosting
      - Support Vector Regression

5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Calculation and interpretation of key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
    - Comparison of model performance.

6. **Conclusion**:
    - Summary of findings.
    - Reflection on the effectiveness of different models.
    - Recommendations based on the analysis.
